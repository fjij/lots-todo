*Task management for the busy.*

Let's face it. Todo lists were never meant to deal with **this much work**. They get so long that it feels like you'll never complete them so you separate them up into multiple todo lists where things get so complicated that you can never find what you are looking for.

**Todo lists can't handle *your* workload.**

Or can they? **lots todo** is a todo list unlike any other. It features all the complex features: multiple todo lists, due dates, task priority ... as well as some features that make the whole experience just a little bit **simpler**.

## Assign tasks for *now*
Sometimes it's hard to focus with so much to do - it's information overload. In order to alleviate this pressure, **lots todo** lets you assign tasks for **now**. Choose the few items that you want to complete **now** and stop worrying about the stuff that needs to be done later. It'll get done, but right now you need to focus.

## Smart Assign
It feels like you should be doing something. But what? **lots todo** has you covered. Click the button and get assigned the most relevant tasks from across all your todo lists. **Smart Assign** considers everything from due date to task duration - you'll never let anything slip.

## Multiplayer
Got a project you want to work on with someone else? Fret not. Share a todo list with them. See when they assign and complete tasks in realtime so your project can never go off the rails.

# Development progress
**lots-todo** is a work in progress. It's not done yet. But it's getting there. Feel free to check in on the open beta at [lots-todo.com](https://lots-todo.com).
